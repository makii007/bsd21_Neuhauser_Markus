# Playberry

Playberry is a game, based on the Python library [*Pygame*](https://github.com/pygame/pygame), which I created as part of my Diplomarbeit.

## Installation

**To run Playberry, the Python library [*Pygame*](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) is required.**

1. Download and unzip the whole project.
2. Run the file `main.py`
   1. If that does not work, you can run the program from the terminal, using `./main.py`.

## Usage

- Use your arrow keys to controll the player.
- With `space` you can attack enemies.

*There is support for most USB and bluetooth controllers*

### Leveleditor

To create your own levels, run `./leveleditor.py` in your terminal. 

- Draw platforms with your mouse and export them directly to game using `t`.
